# Convex-Hull-Clustering
 
Implementrs the Graham scan algorithm https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graham_scan

NOTE!!! All the code was written in one huge function as a fun challange. That is why one functions is ~1000 lines of code. I do not reccomend trying to understand it. Better just read how Graham Scan works
